### Folder Structure

Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- controllers/
|- screens/
|- utils/
|- models/ 
|- main.dart 
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- app_vars - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `colors`, `dimentions`, and `strings`.  
2- screensâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains all the ui of the project, contains sub directory for each screen.
3- utilsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains the utilities/common functions of your application.
4- widgetsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc. 
5- controllersâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains the functions of each screen. 
6- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e orientation etc.
```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```dart
import 'package:boilerplate/routes.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

import 'constants/app_theme.dart';
import 'constants/strings.dart';
import 'ui/splash/splash.dart';

void main() {
  SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([
    DeviceOrientation.portraitUp,
    DeviceOrientation.portraitDown,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeRight,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeLeft,
  ]).then((_) {
    runApp(MyApp());
  });
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: Strings.appName,
      theme: themeData,
      routes: Routes.routes,
      home: SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```
